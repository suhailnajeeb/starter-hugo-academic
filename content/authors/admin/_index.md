I am Suhail Najeeb, a Graduate Researcher at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at The University of Melbourne. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a lecturer at the Department of ECE, East West University in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I hold a Master of Science from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I also completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. As an undergraduate student, I became interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning through my participation in the IEEE Video & Image Processing Cup 2017 & 2018. Since then, I have focused my studies and research on these areas, including the development of novel techniques for volumetric segmentation of lung tumors from CT scans as part of my Master's thesis. My current research involves Computer Vision applications involving Detection.
