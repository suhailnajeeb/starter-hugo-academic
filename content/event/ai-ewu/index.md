# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The last couple of years has seen a sharp rise in the widespread development and adoption of Artificial Intelligence.  With terms like AI, Machine Learning and Data science becoming prevalent everywhere, it is important to be able to distinguish them in a broader sense. Automation is taking over the Engineering industry through applications of artificial intelligence in every sector you can name - Robotics, Computer vision, Biomedical Healthcare, the Auto Industry- the list goes on. This change is perhaps one of the most impactful ones since the industrial revolution and has the potential to reshape the industry by itself. The key factor behind this change is the currency of the new world â€“ Data. It is incomprehensible to the mainstream that in how many different ways we can use data to harness the power of state-of-the-art techniques of Machine Learning. The scope and opportunity of adopting these ideas are no more limited to researchers and experts only. As an Engineer, it has become mandatory to keep up to date with the role of AI in countless engineering applications and be able to use it to our benefit in every possible way. Even without having a deep dive into the topic, AI can be used as an effective tool in so many different ways that we can only imagine."
